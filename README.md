Portfolio of my work

Hello, 
My name is Tim Hurley and i am an amateur games programmer. I have written code for a few different programs, including Flash and Unreal Engine 4. Because of this I have experience in Action-script 3 and Blueprints. I have also looked into Unity as a game engine, and therefore have looked at Javascript.

Please find attached files to examples of my work.

Please don't hesitiate to ask me if you have any questions.

Thanks
